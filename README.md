<ul><h1>Pharmacy-Data-Analytics-Dashboard</h1></ul>
The Pharmacy Data Analytics Dashboard project is designed to address the
growing need for advanced data management and analysis in the pharmacy industry. As
pharmacies navigate an increasingly complex landscape of inventory management, patient
interactions, and regulatory compliance, having access to comprehensive and actionable data is
crucial. This project aims to develop a sophisticated analytics dashboard that consolidates and
visualizes key data points, providing pharmacy stakeholders with the insights they need to make
informed decisions and optimize operations.

# Problem Statement:
● Fragmented Data Sources: Data spread to make it hard to consolidate and analyze. <br>
● Inefficient Reporting: Outdated methods and static reports hinder real-time analysis and decision-making. <br>
● Limited Insights: Lack of tools to track and analyze key performance metrics. <br>
● Inventory Management Issues: Poor forecasting leads to stockouts or overstock, impacting profitability. <br>
● Compliance Challenges: Cumbersome reporting and documentation increase risk of errors and breaches. <br>
● User Experience Problems: Non-user-friendly systems lead to underutilization and inefficiencies. <br>

# Motivation
This pharmacy data analytics dashboard project aims to streamline the management of pharmaceutical
data by providing a user-friendly interface for real-time insights. It will help track inventory levels, sales
trends, and patient prescriptions efficiently, enabling data-driven decision-making. By visualizing key
metrics, this dashboard enhances operational efficiency, reduces waste, and improves patient care,
ultimately driving better outcomes for both pharmacy staff and customers.
